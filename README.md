Hi Guys! 

Daniel here! Im a new born to programming and eager to learn. I am a perfectionist and very open minded. I will need all the help I can get going forward and I would like to thank everyone in advance. Like everyone out there has started from nothing and become a master at coding. My duty will be to give back what I have learned on my journey
